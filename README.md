This project takes in a .wav file input and outputs a transcribed version and summarized version of the file.

In order to run the program, you must have python and flask installed.
Before running, to allow the summary to be produced, you must input your OpenAI API Key at the top of the app.py file.

Note that the transcription service can take a long time as it has to decipher the entire length of your .wav file.

This project is still in development.
